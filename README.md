# Description
This Python script allows users to send an SMS through Python. To achieve this, I researched different APIs that would allow me to send an SMS through Python and determined which one was the most suitable.

## Languages
* Python

## Brief Notes
After writing a script where I could send emails through Python, I decided to do the same for SMS. From my research, this sort of task could get assigned to a developer early in their career, so I wanted to benchmark my ability to achieve this task.

I found there were a lot of options to achieve this and that the settings were a lot more straightforward than sending an email. I didn’t have to write much code at all, which allowed me to focus on the following:
* How to find a suitable API as well as how to search and read the documentation to achieve my goal efficiently
* Gain a more thorough understanding of which parts of the code are sensitive and ensure they are not published
* Provide notes to allow a user to utilize my code using their own information

## Additional Info
* This is the URL for Twilio https://www.twilio.com/en-us 
* You’ll need to install Twilio before you start. To do this you can open the terminal and type the following:

```
pip install twilio
```
